# dave

little helper at work (currently my most useful script. even my collegues know how to use it)

## what does it do?
- get wav-files from nas-system
- convert to mp3
- upload to dropbox
- upload to ftp-server
- stores url's in csv-file for further use
- stores tracklist in txt-file for further use

## to do!
- fix ftp server timeout -> done
- put ftp connection and upload to server at the end -> done
- delete from main.py -> done
- better gui (maybe some kind of an offline webpage, with multiple tabs for just parts of dave: downloading, creating txt, converting to mp3, the whole thing, ...)
- communication with filemaker database -> getting all the necessary infos instead of user-input
- uploading tracklist.csv and codes.csv to mysql-server (awaiting server-relocation, because of missing root rights)
